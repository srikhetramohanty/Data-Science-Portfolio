# Data-Science-Portfolio
**Objective -** 
This is a repository created in line with my understanding &amp; implementation of the major complex ideas in Machine Learning &amp; Inferential Statistics. The motivation behind creating this open source resource is to validate my theoretical knowledge about these models and give back to the online community in terms of a structured and exhaustive format of learning fundamental concepts and best practices of Data Science in the industry.
This repository includes the following elements broadly:
1. Tutorial/comparison/benchmarking notebooks for most of the popular ML and associated data science algorithms like sampling, feature selection, model interpretability, hypothesis testing 
2. From-scratch implementations (using numpy) of most of the commonly used ML models like linear models, CART, gradient boosting, DBSCAN, artificial neural networks etc. These from-scratch implementations have been created based on extensive personal research from online resources available and validated against the necessary benchmarks like Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Scipy etc. For all the cases, the manual implementations have matched up or outperformed the open source python benchmarking libraries mentioned above.
