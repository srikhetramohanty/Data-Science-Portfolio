# Data-Science-Portfolio
**Objective -** 
This is a repository created in line with my understanding &amp; implementation of the major complex ideas in Machine Learning &amp; Inferential Statistics. The motivation behind creating this open source resource is to validate my theoretical knowledge about these models and give back to the online community in terms of a structured and exhaustive format of learning fundamental concepts and best practices of Data Science in the industry.

**Constituent Elements -** 
This repository includes the following elements broadly:
a. **Tutorial/comparison/benchmarking notebooks (In the form of end-to-end ML mini projects)** for most of the popular ML and associated data science algorithms like sampling, feature selection, model interpretability, hypothesis testing in the following manner:

      1. Statistical Inference - Most of the major hypothesis tests and their pre-requisites/use-cases clearly outlined through a hierarchy
      
      2. Pre-Processing of data - Handling extreme imbalance in classes through statistical sampling
      
      3. Feature Selection - Generating feature importances and performing feature selection corresponding to supervised learning
      
      4. Explainable ML - Interpreting the intuition of predictions emanating out of the complex black box models 
      
b. **From-scratch implementations (using numpy)** of most of the commonly used ML models like linear models, CART, gradient boosting, DBSCAN, artificial neural networks etc. These from-scratch implementations have been created based on extensive personal research from online resources available and validated against the necessary benchmarks like Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Scipy etc. For all the cases, the manual implementations have matched up or outperformed the open source python benchmarking libraries mentioned above.   
These include the following:
      1. Statistical Inference - From scratch implementation of popular hypothesis tests like t-test, Kruskal Wallis, Friedmans's test etc. for higher visibility into the inner workings. THese have been benchmarked against the available scipy & statsmodels versions
